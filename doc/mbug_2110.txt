-------------------------------------------


1. OVERVIEW

    The MBUG-2110 GPIO is a general purpose USB input/output device.  Besides
    12 channels digital input/outputs it provides 8 analog inputs (10 bit 
    resolution), 1 PWM output (10 bits duty cycle resolution) and one channel 
    asynchronous serial input/output. 
    The device comes with cross platform C library, Python library and command 
    line tool.  A graphical user interface tool is in preparation.  On Linux,
    platform the device works without drivers by using the libusb-0 library. 
    For Windows platforms, a libusb-win32 based driver is provided.
    
    
1.1 Future extensions

    Counter/Timer input
    Digital input interrupt on change
    Eeprom read/write
    Impulse generator



2. HARDWARE

    The device is based on a PIC18F14k50 microcontroller running at 16Mhz CPU clock.  More extensive 
    specifications on the various built-in hardware modules can be found in the 
    datasheet.  See www.microchip.com for the latest revision.
    
    
2.1 Power supply

    The device is supplied by the USB voltage and does not need an additional 
    power supply.  The current consumption is below 10 mA plus the current 
    delivered by the digital outputs.  The device is available in 5 Volt or
    3.3 Volt versions.

    The electrical connection are merged into two 2x8 pinhead connectors. 
    All I/O pins are contained in J1. J2 provides additional supply voltage
    and ground connections.

2.3 Digital I/O

    The MUBG-2110 provides 12 channels bidirectional digital I/O ports. The 
    port directions for every channel can be set independently.  The maximum 
    current sunk or sourced by any port is 25 mA.  The sum of currents sunk or
    sourced by all ports may not exceed 90 mA.
    Since the digital I/O ports share pins with the other subsystems, the 
    number of available ports depends on which other subsystems are used.  See 
    Tab. 1 for the pin mapping. 


2.4 Analog input

    GPIO 3 to 10 can be individually used as analog inputs.  If a port is 
    configured as analog input, the digital input buffer is disabled.  The port
    can still be used as digital output, however.  To use a port as analog 
    input, set the port direction to input and configure it as analog input.
    The analog inputs can only be read simultaneously.  The ADC resolution is
    10 bits.  For upward compatibilty to higher resolution devices, the ADC
    results are returned left justified in a 16 bit word.
    
    
2.5 PWM output

    Port 0 can be configured as pulse width modulated output.  The digital 
    output function is disabled in this case.  Currently, the PWM frequency 
    is fixed to 15625 Hz.  (However, future revisions my allow to change
    the PWM frequency.)  The PWM duty cycle can be set with 10 bit resolution
    (range 0..1023), corresponding to duty cycles in the range 0..1023/1024.
    
    
2.6 Asynchronous serial port (UART)

    The MBUG-2110 provides one asynchronous serial port (UART). If the UART
    is enabled, the serial recieve input (rx) is mapped to port 10 and the 
    serial transmit output (tx) is mapped to port 2.  In this mode, the digi-
    tal I/O functions on these ports are disabled.  The baudrate can be set to 
    arbitrary values in the range 50-256k, parity van be set to none, set, 
    clear, odd, even. The UARTs subsystem provides transmit and receive queues 
    that can hold up to 64 bytes each. The UART subsystem registers framing 
    errors, parity errors and overrun errors of the transmit and receive 
    queues.

4. USB interface

    This section describes the low level properties of the instruments USB 
    interface. The information provided here is typically not of interest for 
    the user since it is hidden by the host library. It is of interest mainly 
    if the instrument is to be controlled by a third party library or directly
    via low level USB interface functions.

MBUG host software
Installation instructions
-------------------------------------------


0. DOWNLOAD

   The latest release version of the MBUG host software can be downloaded from
     http://www.staff.uni-bayreuth.de/~bt150361/mbug/mbug.zip
   
   The latest development version can be get from github:
     https://github.com/messlinger/mbug_devel
   For the development version, the python module is named mbug_dev, to allow
   both release and develompment modules to be installed concurrently.


1. LINUX


1.1 Prerequisites:

    To build the C library and the command line tools, you will need the Gnu 
    C/C++ compiler and the libusb-dev package.  For example, on Ubuntu run:
    
      sudo apt-get install g++ libusb-dev
      
    If you only want the python module, you only need the libusb-0.1 library,
    which will probably already be installed on our system.  If not:
    
      sudo apt-get install libusb-0.1-4
      

1.2 Installation

    The software comes with a Makefile.

      make all
      
    This will compile the C library and the command line tools.
    
      sudo make install
    
    This will install the C library to /usr/local/lib, the libraries header
    files to /usr/local/include and the command line tools to /usr/local/bin.
    It will also install the python module and create an udev-rule that gives 
    all users full access to all plugged-in mbug devices.  

    To install the python module separately, eg. for a different python 
    version, change to the folder mbug/py/ and execute
    
      sudo python setup.py install
    
    This will install the mbug module (or the mbug_dev module for the develop-
    ment version) to your python library.
    
    
    
2. WINDOWS


2.1 Prerequisites

    None.  

    
2.2 Installation

    The software comes with a pre-built library, command line tools and
    some GUI programs.
    To install, run the setup.exe program in the mbug\ directory (beta). 
    
    To use the C library in your own programs, use the static library from 
    mbug\c\windows\lib\mbug.lib and the header files from folder 
    mbug\c\include\ . The windows library is already contains all depen-
    dencies to the underlying libusb library.  
    
    The python module has to be installed separately: Change to the folder
    mbug\py\ and execute  
    
      python setup.py install  
      
    from the command line.  Alternatively, you can just execute the 
    _install.py script without any parameters (eg. by double-clicking).


2.3 Device drivers

    To use an MBUG device on a Windows platform, a device driver is needed.
    After plugging in a new MBUG device, the operating system will ask for
    a driver location.  Point it to mbug_host\driver\mbug.inf . The driver
    should then be installed automatically.  You can safely disregard any
    messages concerning compatibility or certification.
